# Create 3D worlds

A library of reusable Three.js components that you can play with.

Over the years, I have gathered Three.js examples from various sources and modified them to be reusable.

Unlike other cool Three.js examples that you can just look at, here you can combine different elements and create new scenes. To begin with, you can replace any model or character in these examples.

I hope you will have as much fun as I did making this.
